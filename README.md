# Easy way to use partial views

Patial views are often used to present parts of the pages which are repeated in web application pages.

In this sample project Express is used as a backend framework and Handlebars is used as a view engine.

The main goal is to demonstrate functionality and samples of using Handlebars syntax in:

* Creating and rendering of partial views
* Using 'each' instruction for displaying repeating objects
* Using 'this' instruction when necessary to display contents of the model object
